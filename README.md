# Airplane Fair Price Prediction Web Application

## 1. Introduction
This web application is a Django-based project I developed to predict fair prices for Indian airline tickets. By utilizing machine learning techniques, specifically a Random Forest Regressor, the system estimates ticket prices based on various flight and booking details. The project includes data cleaning, analysis, model training, and a user-friendly web interface for price prediction.

## 2. Project Structure
- **fair_price_prediction/**: Core Django project files including settings, URL routing, and server configurations.
- **adminapp/**: Handles administrative features and backend management.
- **mainapp/**: Contains the main application logic and user-facing views.
- **userapp/**: Manages user accounts and related functionalities.
- **dataset/**: Stores the original and processed datasets used for training the model.
- **assets/**: Includes static resources like CSS, JavaScript, and HTML templates for the frontend.
- **indian-airlines-ticket-price-prediction.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook where I performed data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
- **rf-cyber.pkl**: The saved machine learning model used for making predictions.
- **manage.py**: Djangoâ€™s command-line utility for administrative tasks.
- **db.sqlite3**: SQLite database file for storing application data.

## 3. Dataset and Data Preparation
The dataset contains detailed flight information such as source and destination cities, airline names, departure and arrival times, flight duration, number of stops, travel class, days left until departure, and ticket prices. I performed the following preprocessing steps:
- Identified and handled missing values and outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
- Encoded categorical variables using appropriate encoding techniques.
- Selected relevant features and removed unnecessary columns.
- Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## 4. Machine Learning Model
I trained a Random Forest Regressor with carefully chosen hyperparameters to predict ticket prices. The model was evaluated using metrics like R2 score and mean absolute error to ensure accuracy. After training, I saved the model as `rf-cyber.pkl` for use within the web application.

## 5. How to Set Up and Run the Project
### Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Django 5.1.3
- Other dependencies listed in `requirement.txt`

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a Python virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirement.txt
   ```
4. Apply database migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
5. Start the Django development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/` to access the application.

## 6. Additional Information
- Static files such as stylesheets and scripts are located in the `assets/static/` directory.
- HTML templates for rendering pages are stored in `assets/templates/`.
- Media files uploaded or generated by the application are saved in the `media/` folder.
- The project uses custom context processors to manage user badges, navigation highlights, and profile details.
- SQLite is used as the database backend for simplicity and ease of setup.
